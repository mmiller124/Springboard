This folder contains two projects that I worked on while studying with Springboard.  

The first project, LendingClub, involves lending data and predicts if borrowers will default on their loans.  Data wrangling, data visualization, statistics, and machine learning are all used to make this binary prediction.  

The second project, FlightDelayPrediction, involves flight and weather data and predicts the delay for flights departing Dulles airport.  Again, data wrangling, data visualization, statistics, and machine learning are all used to make the regression prediction.
